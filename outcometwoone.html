    <br>
    <p>Create structures and styles for a webpage. <br>
    You are setting up as an independent consultant, which is very exciting, however, you’re going to need a website of your own to highlight your skills, availability and areas of work. It’s time for you to create a website that details you, and including pages/sections and a how you built it page
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page. <br> <br>
         The home page is an introduction with the “about me” section in it and 5 of my own photographs at the bottom of the page that are held in place using flexbox. The nav bar is on all pages, a simple 5 button flexbox with links to each section of the coursework so that the site is easy to navigate. 
        Then there are 4 further pages, each featuring a nav bar and the different sections of the coursework. Unit 1, outcome 2 features an image on the page, aligned using flexbox. This page also features links in the text, these links are there to provide sources to some of the information on the page regarding risk and GDPR.
        I chose to layout all the pages in a similar way, using white text for all and the same margins for the body, each subsection of the coursework is displayed in a separate paragraph.
        </p>
<br>
<p>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites. <br> <br>
     Copyright is an important part of the internet, and avoiding copyright claims is a straightforward process but it is often overlooked. 
    As long as you are not using any items that are protected under copyright law or using items that you know do not belong to you without permission then it is not something to worry about.
    There is one image on my website that I do not own, and I would have to get permission from the source to use it. The other images I own so there is no need to worry about them, unless someone else were to use them on their own site.
    There is no music or any other media on my website so that cannot cause an issue.
    </p>   
    <br>
    <p>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them. <br> <br>
         The text on my website is not the smallest text but some people with limited vision would struggle to read it. The buttons are large and easy to press so that wouldn’t be as much of an issue. In this case you can choose to zoom using your preferred browser and the page scales well, everything is readable and nothing moves out of place unexpectedly. One thing that I could improve on is making sure that the text is readable for people with issues such as various colourblind types or dyslexia. I think that it is easy to read with it being white on black but I would have to do further user testing or research into the topic. </p> 
    <br>
    <p>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites. <br> <br>
         For my website I chose to use HTML as it is the language of the web and every website has HTML behind the scenes. 
        There is also an option to use .md, a document authoring language that doesn't require the user to type all of the extra characters that come with using HTML. It’s popular uses include technical documentation and blogging.
        <br>
        Other file types that are appropriate are; <br>
        .jpeg for images, boasting low file sizes and good versatility, however they have artifacting and lose some of the detail every time they are re-saved. <br>
        .png for images also, .png files are a lot more versatile than .jpeg files, they support transparency and do not lose quality when they are re-saved. The main drawback for .png is their larger file size. <br>
        Other popular media files include; .gif, .mp3, .wav, .webm, .mpeg.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I have attached screenshots of the website running on both; Mozilla Firefox(left) and Google Chrome (right).</p>
