    <h3>Unit 1: Improving productivity with IT</h3>
    <h3>Unit 1, Outcome 2</h3>
    <p>Review and adapt the ongoing use of IT tools and systems to make sure that activities are successful. Now you have setup your blog, it’s time to get into the detail. You now need to critically review your website. To the bottom of your website add a review section that contains the following information. 
         </p>
    <br>
    <p>2.1 - I have been happy with the tools I used for this project, mainly due to taking the time to sit and assess what it was I wanted to achieve and how I was going to achieve it. Google Docs has been very helpful in allowing me to write out what it is I am going to use on the website, allowing me to better visualise what I am writing and to give it a spell check for any errors I might have made. VSCode is very straightforward to use for both the HTML and the CSS aspects of building the site, I would not want to change that at any point during the project, but I am open to other software to build a website in future. 
            Trello and GitHub have both been paramount in efficiency and keeping my work organised, allowing me to check what needs doing very easily and knowing I’m always working on the most recent file. 
            </p>
    <br>
    <p>2.2 - I think that the tools I have used are very appropriate for this project. VSCode has been relatively easy to use for the project, I’ve not run into any real limitations or issues with it. Trello and GitHub have both worked fine and allowed me to keep on top of the project, as has Google Docs. The only thing that could potentially be more suitable to use is Slack, but as this isn’t a group project and I don’t need to instantly contact anyone or share information I have not opted to use it as much as it could have possibly been used.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2.3 - I am happy with my website, I think it does a great job at displaying the information that I want it to display, it serves its purpose very well. I think that the dark mode theme is very in line with what people are expecting from websites in the current time, there has been a rise in companies implementing dark mode into their apps and sites. I did try to use some nested lists in places to switch up the format a little, but I later decided that it looked better using an undefined list.
        <br>    
        I am a fan of the minimalist design to serve purpose, if this was a website to outline a photography business for example then it would contain a lot more images and fancy features, but I would still try to reflect the minimalist idea.
            I would like to improve the website however, I think that with a little more experimenting and time it could have been more complex and had a little more to it, maybe fancy buttons, links and animations, but I also did not want to over complicate a website designed for presenting coursework and decided my time would be better spent refining what I had before moving on.
            </p>
    <br>
    <p>2.4 - I think the further improvements that I could make would require a little more time on the project. I think the biggest improvement I would make is incorporating some more images into the text to help better explain the points that I am discussing. At the moment I have them linked in the text rather than displaying on the page, which is perfectly functional, but I think maybe having them on the page could have been better.
            <br> 
            The other improvement I would likely make is changing the background image, from the current gradient to possibly something that scrolls with the page, but finding an image suitable and then implementing that is not something I thought about doing until the project was very near to completion and I had become fond of the dark theme and didn’t want to complicate that by having to find dark images where white text would show up without issue, I could have changed the text but I like dark mode and did not want to do that. 
            </p>
    <br>
    <p>2.5 - The purpose of this website is to display the coursework I have done and to show that I have an understanding of website design using HTML and CSS. 
            In my opinion that is exactly what the website does, I have built it to achieve both of those things. I have demonstrated linking, images on the page, text arrangement and listing throughout the site. The website hits the requirements needed and has all the necessary content so I am pleased with the outcome.
