    <p>3.1 - I think that during this project I have aimed for efficiency, tools that have helped with this are Trello and Github. 
            The main benefits of Trello are that I can see what tasks are in what stage of the project, if something is complete I can easily see that it is complete, this also allows me to easily figure out what tasks I need to work on at the start of the day. I am a fan of this style of organisation as it helps the tasks feel smaller and more manageable.
            The main drawback for me with Trello is the time spent entering things into the planner, I could spend a few hours and create an impressive board full of all the information I need, or I could spend far less time and create a board that shows me an outline of the bigger picture, both work but one requires a lot more time than the other. 
            Github is a great option for keeping code up to date and making sure that you’re always working on the latest version. I did plan on using an external drive to store my work but the Mac I am using doesn’t have a standard USB port, so GitHub actually helped me solve this issue and leave my external drive at home, no more forgetting to pick it up either. 
            Other things I have utilised for productivity is using Google Docs to write up my work before entering it into HTML. I could have used Apple Pages but for the sake of doing what I know I used Google Docs, which allows me to spell check everything and keep my writing organised before putting into HTML form.
            I think that whilst teams are a good option, it would have been difficult to organise, and thus created more issues than it solves due to the nature of delegating tasks that reply on another person completing a task on time. For example I cannot edit CSS on a page that hasn’t been written yet as I would have a limited idea of what the final product is going to look like.
            </p>

    <p>3.2 - Improving productivity and efficiency can be a tough task. I could have spent more time on Trello organising a more comprehensive board, but that would have also cost initial time, I do not think that the time saved would be greater than the time spent creating the board.
            I think that organising my days, hour to hour to know exactly what I am supposed to be doing; writing, breaks, working on HTML, would have been a great way to keep myself organised but at the same time, I do not think the time saved would be greater than time spent. 
            Uploading to GitHub is efficient and I am unable to see an option to improve in that area. 
            I do think that, with dedicated planning time, working in teams would be more efficient. I do think this also depends on the members of your team, and ensuring that everyone is on the same page before the project is started. Whilst that does make the process more efficient it also adds other factors that have the potential to reduce efficiency.
            </p>
    <br>
    <p>3.3 - If I were to start the project again there are a few things that I would consider changing to see how the results differ. I think I would make a more comprehensive plan on Trello so that I could cut out the middle man essentially when it comes to reading the material to complete the coursework. At the moment I have the coursework slides as a link in the Trello cards, if I had made the Trello cards with the title and information in them it could be a few less clicks to get to the information I want. 
            I think in the interest of efficiency I would create a small team with clear roles. I think Slack is a great tool for a hub of communication, being able to have a group chat and single chats in the same place without having to hassle anyone for their contact information is very efficient.
            </p>

    <p>3.4 - User testing is something that I have done for my website. Once I had the majority of the content on the website I allowed people to then click through the site and see if they could find any errors or dead links. The user testing was quite helpful in finding some errors that I had missed myself, such as spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. Due to the less complicated nature of the site I did not run into any real problems with the links not working, besides the link to Trello which I had forgotten to link myself earlier. </p>
