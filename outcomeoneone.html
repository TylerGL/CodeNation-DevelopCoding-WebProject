    <h3>Unit 1, Outcome 1</h3>
    <p>Unit 1: Improving productivity with IT Unit 1, Outcome 1 Plan, select and use appropriate IT systems and software to meet needs You are wanting to set up as a consultant. To prove your knowledge you want to start by creating a blog talking about yourself, why you are interested in technology and demonstrate how much you know. For each of the sections below asking you to describe, include around a paragraph of information about the topic.</p>

    <p>1.0 - About Me - My name is Tyler, I am a photography graduate with a strong interest in computers.
            During my time at university I discovered that alongside the artistic processes of photography, I also enjoyed the organised and systematic approach once the photo had been captured. This lead to me spending a lot of time enjoying post processing, working with different file types, processing through an array of different software for each step. I decided to build my own computer to help further my interest in my own time. This is very similar to the reason I came to CodeNation, I wanted to expand my knowledge of computers and coding is a logical step in that direction.

    <p>1.1 - IT and modern business are intertwined, having access to the tools and skills that come with having a good IT department are instrumental to a large, successful business. One of the more impactful reasons is because IT has the potential to make the business run more efficiently, which can help decrease time spent and increase profit margins. Another big purpose of IT in business is that in recent times a huge portion of business have a web presence, and store information on servers. 
    <br>
    All of this information needs to be protected, which leads us to another huge purpose of IT; if everyone is using it, then you need to know how to protect it.
    There are other ways that IT is so important but it mostly revolves around keeping the customer returning to the product, through keeping in touch, keeping their interest with new features or products. Customer outreach and access to knowledge is an important part of modern business.

    <p>1.2 - One of the most important skills in completing a project is good planning. Having a plan and knowing what you’re going to do to complete the project is paramount and it makes the rest of the task less stressful if you know what it is you’re supposed to be doing.
        Using planning tools like Trello will be great to help you do this. The skills needed to complete this project are a good understanding of HTML and CSS, but a desire to see the finished product and a willingness to learn new things are very important skills.
        For this project I will be using VS Code, this is because it’s a great tool that runs on most operating systems, combining the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tools. 
        </p>
    <br>
    <p>1.3 - As discussed earlier, I think that using a Trello board to plan the website will definitely be in my best interests. Being able to plan thoroughly using trello will allow me to keep track of different tasks that will need completing along the duration of the project. Having all of my tasks in one place will help me avoid missing any tasks, having the ability to move them through “to do”, “in progress” and “done” will also help with making sure no tasks get left behind, as I would see them clearly left in the wrong columns. Here is a link to my ongoing <a href="https://trello.com/b/NhZAk4mc/unit-12-by-tyler-london" target="_blank">Trello board.</a>

    <p>1.4 - The risks involved in digital products fall into four main categories; risks that we understand and have a plan to deal with, risks that we understand but don’t have a plan in place for, risks we aren’t aware of but have a plan to deal with, and risks that we aren’t aware of and don’t have a plan in place for. 
        <br>
        Once we understand these risks then we can begin creating risk mitigation plans that will help us work to time constraints, budget constraints etc. We can also create risk mitigation plans for the risks we are aware of but aren’t sure what to do, creating good plans and backup plans for these risks is an important task to undertake but can reduce the fallout of a potential mistake or unforeseen circumstance.

    <p>1.5 - Selecting the right technology for the job
        Selecting what the right tools for the job are starts with figuring out what job requires.
        In this instance I will be building a website using HTML and CSS. I know that VSCode is multi platform so I don’t have to worry about that, I can use it on a Mac in the office and on Windows at home.
        I’ve chosen VSCode because that’s the software I’m familiar with and also it has everything I need to complete the job. If the job was an iPhone app for example your first port of call would be XCode, as that is the right fit.
        </p>
    <br> 
    <p>1.6 - As stated I have been using Trello to make a plan for how I intend to create the website and load the information onto it. Being able to easily see what tasks need doing, what tasks I’ve started and what tasks I’ve already completed makes organising what I need to do at any given time a much simpler task. <br>
        I’ve also been using GitHub to help with my code’s version control, making sure I am uploading to GitHub a few times a day. This gives me the freedom to work at home after hours by just downloading my work from GitHub and then making sure that I re-upload any files after working on them, so they’re here for the next day. This has been very useful and has eliminated the need to carry around an external drive with my work on it, meaning I don’t have to worry about not having my files as they’re uploaded online. 
        <br>
        The main drawback of this is that if I forget to upload to GitHub after doing work at home, then the next day at the office I am going to be working with the most recently updated on GitHub, not the files I finished working on. To avoid this issue I have formed a habit of regularly updating my GitHub files.

    <p>1.7 - There are six main constraints to any project; 
        <dl>
        <dt><a href="https://www.interruptdelivers.com/themash/what-is-risk-in-a-digital-project-and-why-should-i-care" target="_blank">Risk</a> - What can go wrong, and what can be done about it?</dt> 
        <dt>Resources - Who and what is required to do the work?</dt>
        <dt>Quality - How close the outcomes matches the expectations?</dt>
        <dt>Scope - What exactly is the expected outcome?</dt>
        <dt>Time - When should the outcome be delivered by?</dt>
        <dt>Cost - How much money is available to achieve this outcome?</dt>
        </dl>
    </div>
        <img id="cnst" src="img/constraints.png" alt="cnst">
</div>
</dl>
    These constraints are interlinked, affecting one will affect another. This means that the constraints must be balanced so that the quality does not suffer. For example, if time is not balanced properly then it will cost more to get things finished quickly, or if resources aren’t available then time will have to increase to allow them to become available, this may also cause cost to rise as to lesser impact the time needed. I have added an image of a simplified constrains triangle above, this one discards risk and resources but the concept is the same.<br>

    <br>
    GDPR is the General Data Protection Regulation, and it’s main focus is to increase the protection for personal data. This means that a few things have changed since this has come into legal effect;
    <dl>
        <dt>Active opt-in - Users must actively opt in to giving companies their data, and will be asked and have the option to decline.</dt>
        <dt>Granular - Users should have as much detail as possible as to what their data is being used for, and have the option to opt out of certain uses.</dt>
        <dt>Unbundling - Consent requests must now have their own section, they cannot be bundled in with accepting terms and conditions.</dt>
        <dt>Not a precondition of service - Consent of data cannot be a precondition of signing up to a service unless necessary.</dt>
        <dt>Named - It should be clear to the user who will be processing their data, including any third parties.</dt>
    </dl>
    This means that users have access to better privacy over their data, choosing if and what to share with the site. This means that digital marketers will only be able to process the data they really need, as they will have to obtain legal justification as to why they are collecting the data. <a href="https://www.edelman.co.uk/insights/how-will-gdpr-impact-digital-marketing-professionals" target="_blank">The maximum fine for ignoring GDPR is €20 million or 4% of your total worldwide annual turnover</a>, whichever of those two amounts is the highest.
