    <p id="aboutme">About Me</p>
    <p>My name is Tyler, I am a photography graduate with a strong interest in computers.
            During my time at university I discovered that alongside the artistic processes of photography, I also enjoyed the organised and systematic approach once the photo had been captured. This lead to me spending a lot of time enjoying post processing, working with different file types, processing through an array of different software for each step. I decided to build my own computer to help further my interest in my own time. This is very similar to the reason I came to CodeNation, I wanted to expand my knowledge of computers and coding is a logical step in that direction.
